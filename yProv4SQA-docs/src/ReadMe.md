This library is part of the yProv suite, and provides a unified interface for logging and tracking provenance information in machine learning experiments, both on distributed as well as large scale experiments. 

It allows users to create provenance graphs from the logged information, and save all metrics and parameters to json format.


yProv4SQA is part of the yProv ecosystem that focuses on multilevel provenance document management. 
To gain complete insights about software quality evaluation, we introduce the concept of provenance for Software Quality Assurance processes called yProv4SQA, which is used for tracking the evolution of software quality over time by generating detailed provenance documents during software development.
